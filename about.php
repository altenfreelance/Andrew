                  <p class="pageBody" style="text-align:center">I was born and raised in the Cincinnati area and went to Loveland City Schools. I come from a loving and supportive family including my parents, two older brothers, and fianc√©e. I attended Loveland High School where I involved myself in football, wrestling, and jazz band. It was during high school where I first developed a passion for programming and computer science. After much athletic success in high school, including state championship titles in football and wrestling, I received a scholarship from the University of Findlay to continue my technological, academic and athletic careers. Playing college football was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I gained essential life skills such as leadership, dedication, passion, and teamwork. I pursued majors in Computer Science and Mathematics and became involved with multiple internships. I can truly say that I enjoyed every part of my growth at the University of Findlay and have chosen to further my career by pursing my master's degree in data analytics.
